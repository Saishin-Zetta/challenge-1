# <Challenge-1>

## Description

This project was a short challenge for the week outlining how to clean up the coding and styling for pre-existing page; refactoring. Throughout the challenge changes were made so that the html file was easier to read, was less cluttered, and small buttons were fixed so as to be utilized by the user. Comments were also added to help future developers understand where the styling for certain properties are.

Overall what I learned is that one party; the people who developed the page, would still benefit from having a seperate person or persons looking over the completed work allowing for a more complete and organized project which would allow future devs to continue to update the page.
